The logic statement evaluator only accepts booleans and operators, while the theorem prover accepts variables and expands all its possible values using a truth table. Moving forward we'd like to parse sequents and implement the analytic tableux method.

The adoption of [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) makes the use of parenthesis optional. For example, the statement `(P (P Q ->) ^ Q ->)` can be written as `P P Q -> ^ Q ->` without any issues for the parser.
